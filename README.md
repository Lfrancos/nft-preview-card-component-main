## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
 - Sass scss
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This is the first time that I've used animation for the hover effects. That was interesting, still need to fully understand what I'm doing there, this was a fast try but need to understand how they really work so that I can crete more interesting things.



### Continued development

I really need to work harder to use git, this time I only added this to git up until I finished the project and that is not what it is supposed to happen.
I need to add the starting files first that way I'll be able to go back if I need to. And also add things incrementally so if I need to go back I can do it and the code is not difficult to maintain.

There are two things that are not working:

> First, the overlay of the image is covering more than it is supposed, and I haven't been able to fix that.

> Second, the icon of the clock is stretched, and I only set the "width" so I really don't understand why this is stretching.
